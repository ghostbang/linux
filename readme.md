What is Ghostbang?

Ghostbang is a Linux operating system for the [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/) computer.

#####A Ghost Story

Ghostbang comes from the ashes of [Crunchbang](http://crunchbang.org/). When Crunchbang and [Pibang](http://pibanglinux.com/) ceased development, I decided to roll my own distro. Ghostbang is being developed for the Raspberry Pi with hobbyist intentions. Releases will be sporadic and rules of convention will be broken.
