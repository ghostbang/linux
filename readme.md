What is Ghostbang? 

Ghostbang is a Debian-based Linux operating system for the [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/) computer.

After [Crunchbang](http://crunchbang.org/) and [Pibang](http://pibanglinux.com/) ceased development, I decided to roll my own distro. Henceforth, Ghostbang arose from the ashes. Ghostbang is being developed for the Raspberry Pi with hobbyist intentions. Releases will be sporadic and rules of convention will be broken. However, it is my wish that this operating system stays usable and current in effort to allow others to freely use, contribute, fork and to study.
