What is Ghostbang? 

Ghostbang is a Debian-based Linux operating system for the [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/) computer. It is also a personal project.

After [Crunchbang](http://crunchbang.org/) Linux and [Pibang](http://pibanglinux.com/) ceased development, I decided to roll my own distro. Hence, Ghostbang arose from the ashes. My goal with Ghostbang is to start from a minimal build to a distro similar to the look and lightweight experience Crunchbang/Pibang had. For now, the scope of Ghostbang will focus on the Raspberry Pi platform. 

This project is also a hobby. That means, releases will be sporadic, bugs will appear, and rules of convention will be broken. For educational reasons, a series of nerdy [journals](https://github.com/rixwoodling/linux/tree/master/journals) and [release notes](https://github.com/ghostbang/linux/blob/master/releases.md) will be available for the public in effort to catalog all updates and changes made along the way.
